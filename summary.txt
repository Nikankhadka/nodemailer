this is the basic over view of what i am doing and learning through out the building process of this email sender api 

//here we are using the node mailer module which makes sending mails through node easier, here i dont nedd to structure my api since
it is simple test to check whether the api is working properly.


//since node mailer module and its api,functions are pretty easy to use
//node mailer can use direact passwords and send mail but if u are using verification it can be hard  or 2 step auth it is hard to setup 

since node mialer is quite versatile and can work with multiple email sender service like outlook or other u can use those 
for sending as well in place of gmail, since gmail is hard to setup, and might fail completely u can use other 
service, basically can send mail( from cregistered mail service provider/sender account that will be company or admin accoint)
using that can send mail to other user




********************for Gmail*******************
// so setp a projet in google gloud to pass in the credential along with auth data for sending the mail which is actually better 
way to do it since u are going to setup authentivation using passport and u can use the same credential for the nodemailer aswell 
for more secure approahc towards email sending 

//there is long process so better look it up how to setup in free code camp nodemailer email sending 

//store all the necessaru credential in the env file and igonre that  with gitignore 

//while setting up the credential for the sender note that u need to enable less secure app in gmail, if 2 step vefication is enabled
then u need to

try to follow this 




********************************using microsoft outlook to send mail****************
its preety easy to use just sign in with microsft accoun in the outlook and setup the outlook dont need to do extra 
then use the same credentail with nodemailer to create transporter instance then send mail




*******************************zoho****************************
similarly zoho also provides multiple choice for u to use zoho to send mail first sign in in zoho then select the mailing sercive
then setup the mail account use the mail account  ...zoho.com with the original account password(make sure to use mail account instead of main account in zzoho)


then similarly follow thr process create transpoter instacne by passing tin the credentail annd provide mail options use sendmail functions to send the mail 



*********************************send grid has its own module and api to send mail*********************
so no need to setup nodemialer here they are very simialr to use provides the same syntax to send mail


first need to create send grid account then setup web api fro email sending as u are guided with steps to do 
.first setup an api key then use that key  not only that but also need to create a verified sender identity with 
that is the email u are going to use as a sender in node once that is complete then can proceed with email sending applicaiton in node js 


//install the moduels to acess api 
npm install --save @sendgrid/mail
simple
import module
then module.setapi key to setup the api key that u created in send grid 
then similar to node mailer provide mail option pass that into the send function since its promised based the response returned will be passed
into the argument of the callback function on .then and rr in catch




*****************************For verificatio email sending *********************************
first create a verification route which is going to accept the credential thrugh route para or headers. then acess to verify the toke 

once that is done when verrifcaiton email is send to the user provide <a> link to the verification route and also attach the token 
or value in the query para which is then accessed by then verification to verify the user
